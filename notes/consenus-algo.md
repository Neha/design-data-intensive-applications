 When working with distributed systems :

1. Nodes can crash or become unreachable
2. Messages may be delayed or arrive out of order
3. There is no shared memory

To build a reliable and fault-tolerant system, we need to:

1. Elect a leader (agree on a single coordinator)
2. Agree on the order of transactions or updates
3. Ensure consistency across replicas

This is where consensus algorithms come in.

A consensus algorithm is a protocol that helps multiple nodes in a distributed system agree on a single value or decision, even in the face of failures like network issues or node crashes.

Without consensus, systems can become inconsistent or make conflicting decisions.

Popular Consensus Algorithms:

1. Paxos – Classic, but complex to implement
2. Raft – Easier to understand and widely adopted
3. Zab – Used in Apache Zookeeper
4. PBFT – Byzantine Fault Tolerant (handles malicious nodes)
